// the dodge; run / roll are procedural, with his carry overlay):
//   idle     breathing loop (0.5 = idle + breath)
//   air      t 0 take-off (stretched) · 0.22 tuck · 0.55 apex · 1 falling at jumpV (legs reaching down)
//   airFall  after an air string: 0.5 (vy 0) → 1, legs gathering under him
//   land     hold the crouch, then rise into idle (LOCO.landFrames); hurt snaps into recoil, holds, then recovers
// The legs of the air poses are shared (Zhao Yun's); the officer's specs give the body, weapon and arms.
