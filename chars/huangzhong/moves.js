// Huang Zhong moveset (data only), modelled on the DW7/DW8 弓 (bow) moveset: the string mixes bow-limb slashes at
// arm's length with point-blank shots, the charges are shots (fan, barrage, rain, fire arrow), plus the DW5 aim mode
// (瞄準: hold △ from neutral). All timings in 60 Hz sim frames. Format = header of src/hero/moves.js, plus:
//
//   shots: [{ f: frame (or [first, last] with `every`), n arrows, spread (total fan, degrees), dir (degrees, + = left),
//             pitch (degrees, + = up), speed (m/s), g (gravity, m/s²), range (m of homing flight before the arrow drops),
//             pierce (extra bodies it passes through), rad (hit radius, m), home: soft-lock cone (degrees, 0 = none;
//             DW auto-aim: the nearest soldier in the cone, the arrow curves after him), air: lock airborne bodies first,
//             big: 1 heavy arrow / 2 musou giant (render scale), fire: flaming arrow, burst: {range, dmg, kb, force, lift,
//             heavy, hitstop} ground/impact explosion, burstEnd: explode when the range runs out (not only on the
//             ground), rain: {n, r, ahead, delay, over, launchLast} — the shot goes skyward and n arrows fall in a
//             circle r (m) round the soft target (or `ahead` m in front) from `delay` frames later over `over` frames,
//             dmg, kb, force, lift, hitstop, heavy: the hit spec each arrow applies (combat.hitOne) }]
//   strafe      [f0, f1, m/s]: the stick moves him sideways/back through the window without turning him (C4)
//   tell        set by hand on shot moves (no hitbox to derive it from): frames to the first shot (charge ring, soft-lock)
//
// Reach & balance vs Zhao Yun: slashes are narrower and shorter (bow limb ≈ 0.9 m past the grip → arcs 2.2–2.5 m,
// 90–160°) and lighter, so a packed ring hurts more; shots reach 15–25 m (arrow 55–80 m/s: faster than anyone can run,
// ≈ 0.3 s to 20 m), soft-lock onto the nearest soldier in a cone and pierce 1–4 bodies, the finisher shots 12+. Clears
// come from lines (N6, C1, dash), fans (C3, jump charge), the barrage (C4), rain (C5) and the fire burst (C6).
// Timing: onsets N1–N6 ≈ 24–30 sf apart like the spear string; shots release on the frame the string snaps (the anims
// hold the full draw 2–4 sf before it). Charges hold the finish ≈ 0.3 s. dodgeCancel = the frame after the last
// shot/hit window. Aim mode (moves.aim, driven by src/chars/huangzhong/aim.js, not by combo.js): C1 from neutral held
// past AIM_AT becomes the aim; the aim clip is keyed draw 0 → 14 (full) → release 16 → follow-through → 30 = frame 0.
