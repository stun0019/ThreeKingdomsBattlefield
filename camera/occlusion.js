/**
 * Boom clearance: the share (0..1] of the focus → camera segment that stays over open, walkable ground. The boom is
 * marched in `n` samples; it is blocked where it leaves the walkable field by more than `slack` m (castle wall, cliff
 * edge, valley side: whatever map.js clampWalk fences off — but never over open water: a pool or a wide river behind
 * the hero is off the walk field, not a wall) or dips under `floor` m above the terrain (a slope rising behind the
 * hero). The rig pulls the camera in to the last clear sample (DW8: the camera slides in along the boom at walls
 * instead of clipping through them). Pure: only map.js lookups, no scene raycast (voxel sets are instanced).
 * ponytail: the walk fence stands in for wall geometry (the castle wall face sits 3 m past it); an invisible fence on
 * open ground (the old arena disc) also pulls in, and a prop inside the field (a tower) is not tested. Upgrade: a
 * map.js blocker query (walls / cliffs as segments) if the long field needs finer occlusion.
